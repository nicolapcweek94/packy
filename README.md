###What is packy?
An experiment with python features, with the only goal of improving my python skills. So, yeah, don't use this as a pacman alternative, thanks.
  
###But I want to use it! How do I use it?
You don't?
But yeah, in theory it's all working, so just download `packy.py`, write your `repo.json` and put it in the same folder (or pass it as an argument, with the `-r` switch) and enjoy.
